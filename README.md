# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Excel)

## Business Problem
Telecom companies lose significant revenue when customers churn.
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify churn drivers
and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## Dataset
- 1,000+ customer records
- Features include tenure, usage, monthly charges, and churn status
- Synthetic dataset structured to reflect real-world telecom data

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- VLOOKUP and IFERROR
- Calculated fields
- Dashboard design

## Analysis Performed
- Churn rate by customer tenure
- Revenue impact of customer churn
- Identification of high-risk customer segments
- Relationship between charges and churn behavior

## Key Insights
- Customers with less than 6 months tenure showed the highest churn rates
- Higher monthly charges were associated with increased churn
- A small percentage of customers accounted for a large share of lost revenue

## Business Recommendations
- Introduce retention incentives for new customers
- Proactively target high-risk customers with personalized offers
- Review pricing strategies for high-charge customer segments

## Analyst Notes & Considerations
- The analysis assumes customer behavior patterns remain consistent over time.
- Churn risk is higher among new customers, suggesting onboarding experience is critical.
- Pricing alone does not explain churn; customer tenure and usage patterns play a significant role.
- Further analysis using customer support interactions could improve churn prediction accuracy.
